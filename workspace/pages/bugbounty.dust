      <p class="normal">Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Programs by <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/">Mozilla</a>, and others have helped to create a strong bug-hunting community. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides some prizes and cold hard cash for their efforts.</p>

  <h2 class="txt--red larger marg__bottom--x2">FAQs</h2>

  <h3>How are bounty payments made?</h3>

  <p>All bounties are currently paid via PayPal.</p>

  <h3>Can I donate my reward to a charity?</h3>

  <p>Yes. We know that some of you would prefer your bounty reward go toward helping someone else. If you choose, we will donate your reward to an established charitable organization of your choice. DADI will also match your donation - subject to our discretion. Any rewards that go unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.</p>

  <h3>I don&#8217;t live in the United Kingdom, or I&#8217;m under 18, am I eligible?</h3>

  <p>Yes, international researchers are eligible. Researchers between 13 and 18 years of age are also eligible, however, those in the United Kingdom will need to provide guardian consent before any payment can be made.</p>

  <h3>I reported a vulnerability but have not received a response!</h3>

  <p>Please allow up to 24 hours for an initial response. Also realize that spam filters and email in general can sometimes be problematic. If you ever feel we are not communicating in a timely fashion, definitely <a href="https://dadi.tech/contact/">let us know</a>.</p>

  <h3>How is the bounty reward determined?</h3>

  <p>Our engineering team take many factors into account when determining a reward. These factors include the complexity of successfully exploiting the vulnerability, the potential exposure, as well as the percentage of impacted users and platform layers. Sometimes an otherwise critical vulnerability has a very low impact simply because it is mitigated by some other component, e.g. requires user interaction, an obscure web browser, or would need to be combined with another vulnerability that does not currently exist.</p>

  <h3>What are points?</h3>

  <p>In addition to giving researchers money and/or prizes, we are trying to make this fun. We assign a point value to each vulnerability and list it on this site. The researchers with the most points are listed on our leaderboard. While we use many of the same metrics when determining point value as for dollar value, other non-tangible factors are considered as well. For example, if you provide an awesome write-up of a vulnerability with a functional POC, that will be factored in.</p>

  <h3>What if I do not want my submission published on the bounty website?</h3>

  <p>Please still send us your vulnerability! We will only publish your submission after your approval. To be visible within the leaderboard you must provide us with a name and your GitHub username. This allows us to link submissions to your Git profile.</p>

  <h3>What are the legal terms of the Bug Bounty program?</h3>

  <p>By participating in DADI&#8217;s Bug Bounty program (the “Program”), you acknowledge that you have read and agree to DADI&#8217;s <a href="https://dadi.tech/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a> as well as the following:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Your participation in the Program will not violate any law applicable to you, or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for any applicable taxes, withholding or otherwise, arising from or relating to your participation in the Program, including from any bounty payments</li>
  <li>DADI reserves the right to terminate or discontinue the Program at its discretion</li>
  </ul>
